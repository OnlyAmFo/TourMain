- Receive personalized recommendations based on their interests

### 1.3 Objectives

1. Develop an AI-powered platform for personalized trek recommendations
2. Implement an interactive chatbot for instant travel assistance
3. Create a user-friendly interface for trek discovery and booking
4. Integrate comprehensive trek information and details
5. Ensure responsive design for seamless mobile experience

### 1.4 Scope

The project encompasses:

- Frontend development using React.js
- Backend implementation with Node.js and Express
- Database management using MongoDB
- AI integration through Hugging Face API
- User authentication and profile management
- Trek suggestion and booking system
