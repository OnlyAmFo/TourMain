      "Learn how to prepare and acclimatize for high-altitude treks in the Himalayas. Our expert guide covers everything from gear to breathing techniques.",
    content: `High-altitude trekking in Nepal presents unique challenges and rewards. The key to a successful trek lies in proper preparation and understanding of altitude-related issues.
